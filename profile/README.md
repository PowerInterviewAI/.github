### What we’re building

- **Stealth Mode:** Discreet on-screen operation (hotkeys, opacity, positioning) designed to be **non-capturable** during screen share  
- **Smart Export:** DOCX transcript export with AI summaries, insights, and communication-pattern analysis  
- **Real-Time Face Swap:** Live video transformation via OBS + VB-Cable (intended for legal, responsible use)
